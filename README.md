The files in this directory are from part of a 2D engine implemented using Roblox UI objects and Luau OOP.
It's very performant; this sample implementation only takes an average of .844ms to fully execute! (according to the microprofiler)

FILE OVERVIEW:
- Game.lua		- Main localscript; Lives inside a permanent GUI on the player and serves as an example implementation.
- Map.lua		- Map Class; used to store and manipulate the tile information.
- TileScreen.lua	- TileScreen Class; responsible for creating, maintaining, and updating the player's local visuals.
